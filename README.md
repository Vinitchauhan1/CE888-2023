# CE888-2023
In the academic year 2023, take the CE888 (Data Science and Decision Making) course.

This particular repo contains the code of the empathy assement using the eye tacker data. A deep study was conducted using different algorithms using the machine learning and deep learning and all the results are summarized perfactly in the report. 


Type of ML and DL algorithms that are used in it.
1. Finding the correlation matrix to find the nuber of correlated features with the target variable.
2. Using the unsupervised learning to find the optimal number of cluster which can provide us more insights into empathy score.
3. Next we have used the neural network using the keras api on the top of tensorflow.
4. we have used to RRN_GRU to find the classification task with getting the resonable accuracy.
